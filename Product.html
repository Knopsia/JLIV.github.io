    <p><font size = 5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The product, "Geopolymer Bricks" utilizes discarded materials such as limestone, tarpaulin, glass bottles, and plastic wrappers as aggregates. Compared to a traditional brick, the company used fly ash to produce a cheaper brick. The production of Geopolymer Bricks starts when the company received and checked the raw materials. Afterwards, combining the materials; pulverized glass, fly ash, limestone, shredded tarpaulin, and plastic wrappers, then letting it dry. They propose the product to be tested by several tests such as drop and compression tests. If the brick passes these tests, it is ready to be distributed and sold to the customers. For the product to be successfully deemed an eco-friendly, and an alternative of standard bricks, Forte Laryó’s geopolymer bricks will be sold both in retail and wholesale for 12 pesos a piece. It can be lowered by 10% with a minimum purchase of 50 pieces. </font> </p>
